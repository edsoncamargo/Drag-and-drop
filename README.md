**ec-drag-and-drop** is a straightforward project that features a static Kanban board with three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. The primary objective of this project is to provide a hands-on experience and demonstration of drag and drop functionality for managing tasks across different stages. It's important to note that this example is static, and additional lanes or tasks cannot be added. The project is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and Sass, serving as a valuable resource for learning and practicing drag and drop interactions.

## Technology

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for building dynamic functionality.
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web page.
- **SASS**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.
